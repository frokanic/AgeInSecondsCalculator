# 🕒 Age in Seconds Calculator App

The Age in Seconds Calculator App is an Android application developed as part of the [The Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/) on Udemy. Being a slightly more experienced developer, instead of skipping this project, I decided to use it to experiment with Jetpack Compose. This application allows users to calculate the time difference between two dates in seconds, providing features for selecting dates, calculating the seconds between them, and clearing the selection, all designed using Jetpack Compose.

## ✨ Features

- 📅 Pick any date using the date picker.
- ⏱️ Calculate the seconds between the picked date and the current date.
- 🔄 Update the seconds every second to keep the display accurate.
- ❌ Clear the selected date and the calculated seconds with a single action.
- 🏗️ Built using Kotlin and Clean Architecture principles for maintainability and testability.
- 🔗 Utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for separation of concerns.
- 🌱 Implements the [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) dependency injection framework for improved modularity and testability.
